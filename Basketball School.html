            <h2>Main Rules of The Game</h2>
            <h3 id="rulesscoring">Scoring and Points</h3>
            <p>
                Basketball can be very complicated for a beginner, but for the most part what we know indefinately is that u score when the ball goes through the hoop/basket.
                There are a few rules to this however. Conventionally when you score from beyond the designated 3 point arc (which is usually marked 20 to 24 feet away from the rim) you gain 1 extra point than a regular field goal.
                normally a regular field goal is 1 or 2 points depending on the format of the game (we will see this later) once you do not interfere with the ball once it is directly above the rim.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="fouling">Fouling</h3>
            <p>
                Fouling someone is the act of unnecessarily, unfairly, or illegaly impeding an opponent's movinment, path towards the basket or attempt to score after which a foul will be called.
                if the foul occurs during a shot attempt or in excession of an allowed fouling threshold then two or three free attempts without impedance from the free throw line
                (15 straight ahead feet from the rim) are given with each free throw made equating to one point. You can foul somneone by tripping them over, excessively pushing them away, slapping/hitting said person
                without making contact with the ball or potenially dangerously hitting or getting in a player's way despite getting the ball, it is all left up to the referee's judgement
            </p>
            <br>
            <H3 id="violations">Violations</H3>
            <p>
                <h4>Travelling -</h4> You can not take in excess of 3 steps without boucing the basetball. This might seem complicated and difficult to commit to at first glance
                however, due to gravity and natural human movement this comes without thinking (once there is no pressure that is).
                <br>
                <h4>Doubling/Double Dribble -</h4> You Can not cease your dribble and commence it one again without passing the ball to a teammate or attempting a shot.
                In essence, you can not bounce the ball, pick it up then bounce it again. If you pick up the ball after your dribble the only thing you can do is pass it to a teammate or shoot it.
                <br>
                <h4>Out of Bounds -</h4> Different sports have different "out of bounds" rules like in football the ball is deemed out of play when the entire ball has crossed the lines which define the field of play
                whether the ball is in the air or on the ground. In basketball however, the ball is only deemed out when it bounces out of bounds or a player touches the ball whilst they themselves are out of bounds.
                the ball only needs to touch the line or play to be classified as ou of bounds and not completely cross it. This definition of the rule is akin to scoring a boundary in cricket, you can lunge, dive or stretch
                for the ball as much as you like as long as neither you nor the ball touch or land beyond the line of play. In addition, if you do manage to save the ball for going out before landing
                you are only eligible to touch it once more once both feet have landed back within play, doing so befor said action deems you as technically out of play and in association the ball as well.
                <br>
                <h4>Technical Fouls -</h4> A technical foul is given against a player when the referee deems his conduct to be disrespectful or unsportsmanlike.
                this can be through the use of profane language or gestures towards fans, opponents or officials and also through malicious acts such as kick the ball away or throwing it with force delibrately
                at an opponent. A technical foul grants the team who is victim of the violation one free throw, regular play the resumes as was before.

            <H1>How to play</H1>
            <H2 id="structure">Simple structure</H2>
            <p>
                In its very base form basketball is a dynamic multi-possession ball sport. The main focus of the sport is to score in your opponents basket/goal whilst defending your own basket/goal, until the end of
                an allotted amount of time or until a target score is obtain by either player/team the game continues, the player/team with the most points in the winner. possession may sometimes change
                whenever an individual attempts a shot whether the attempt was sucessful or not or in other forms whoever grabs the ball first after a shot was attempted.
                possession can also change if the player/team without possession legally takes the ball away from the player/team with the ball. The default form of the sport is seen as a 5 on 5
                team game played on 2 opposing baskets/goals, however there are multiple forms that the sport can take on and it is all suited to the amount of individuals present and the resources available.
            </p>

            <h2 id="formats">Forms of the game</h2>
            <h3>5 on 5</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>5 on 5 full court - </h4>As we explained earlier at the most professional level basketball takes on a 5 vs 5 team format where each team has 4 intervals of 10 - 12 minutes (40 - 48 in total) to outscored their opponent.
                The game takes place in between two opposing baskets/goals on either side of the court of play. Each team is allowed a few extra players to substitute in and out as long as only 5 players are on the court at all times.
                Substitutions can take place anytime the ball has gone out of bounds or play has stopped (play is not considered to be stopped after a player scores, the game is still live).
                <br>
                <h4>5 on 5 half court - </h4> This format of the game is similar to full court in terms of structure of players. However there are usually less substitutes as this form sees the game being played on only one basket/goal, this is because
                less running is required in this format and thus less energy is consumed by either team. Whoever has possession of the ball in ths form must try to score a basket, when possession changes the ball must be brought above the 3 point line
                before the other team can attempt to score in return (this is called "clearing"), violating these rules usually results in a lost of possession or an addition of an extra point for the opposing team.
                In some cultures if your attempt at scoring does not make contact with the basket or if you lose possesion via a steal then the opponent can attempt a shot right away without "clearing" the ball.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>3 on 3</h3>
            <p>
                Recently 3 on 3 has seen a surge in popularity within the sport and has now become its own professional brand. this format of the game was once considered casual however, with the globalization of the sport
                it has been taken much more seriously with the implementation of world ranking, professional competitions and a World 3x3 Tournament. 3 on 3 follows rules which are similar to half court 5 on 5, the main difference in the number of players
                each team may field. Each team has 3 active players on the court at all times, with the game being played in a half court setting. Each team can field only one substitute bring the total number of team members up to 4. Play takes place over a
                period of 10 minutes or until a team has score 21 points. Instead of points counting for 2 and 3 in this format they now count for 1 and 2 respectively. This version of the game is fast paced and chaotic as there is some much more
                space to move around in this format with4 less players in total present on the court. Every must be "cleared"
            </p>

            <H3>Individual Formats</H3>
            <P>
                <h4>1 on 1 -</h4> This is the simplest form in individual basketball, no passing out to reset yourself no screens to help you get to the basket easier and no teammates. It is just you the ball and your opponent
                and the aim of the game is to score. These typically have claering rule and the rest in self explanatory you score then your opponent gets their chance and so on and so on until someone wins. However, some
                prefered to play it where if you score then you retain possession, this then leaves the only way to change possession being a missed shot or a steal, This rule promotes high value play more than anything else
                as, pressure is put on each individual to hold possession of the ball as much as possible. This format of the game is credited with improving the talent and skill of many a player and is a staple in the sport.
                <br>
                <h4>King of The Court</h4> This format follows 1 on 1 rules but with multiple players. "How?" you may ask, well it is simple. Lets say we have 4 players, 2 of the 4 take position on the court and play a 1 vs 1 game, first
                to score remains on the court and the indivual who lost exits the court. A new player then steps onto the court and the process is repeated until one of the 4 players reaches a certain amount of wins. If you were recently defeated
                then you go to the back of the line, this gives everyone a fair amount of attempts.
                <br>
                <h4>"21" - </h4>
                "21" is often considered the least constructive of any format of the game and can be seen more commonly played among younger players. In "21" there may be as many players as possible once the court is not too crowded.
                each player battles with one another in a free for all to grab the ball off of a rebound and gain possession. The player in possession now attempts to score. if successful they then have to make 3 free throws to retain possesion of the ball.
                if not then whoevcer catches the rebound now has possession and a chance to score. Whoever is first to 13 points can now claim "out!", whoever does not have at the least 5 points
                now has to leave the court. If only 1 or 2 players remain then the one who called "out!" is the winner, but if more than 2 players remain they then battle it out until someone amasses 21 points.
                Depending on the amount of people in the game clearing rules may vary, also whenever the ball goes out of play whoever retrieves it first has possession of the ball.

            <h3>Layup</h3>
            <p>A layup is a simple basket/goal made in close proximity to the rim, unlike with a jumpshot a layup is made while moving and it does not follow structural movement. Your only aim with a layup up is to get the ball in the rim however your body feels it can.<br><img src="https://i.giphy.com/4kBzA7kC5cb26EAv94.webp"></p>

            <h3>Jumpshot</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike a layup a jumpshot is needed most of the time when a play is a significant distance from the rim where they more or less need to throw the ball at the rim. A jumpshot is important for this because it helps maintain a standard which results in more
                accurate attempts at scoring. The "Jump" in jumpshot is essential because it helps generate more power through the rest of the body up to the arms resulting in less energy being exerted from the arms.<br><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNzRieTY5MWxtNTk2b256amhicnA4em1pYngwZ3BlNGhoanNtdTJwcSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/l3974YfICOTcOM8kE/giphy.gif">

            <h3>Dunk</h3>
            <p>
                A dunk is when a player is close enough to the basket and has adequate jumping ability or height so mcuh so that they can essentially drop the ball into the rim guiding it through the enitre way. for a long time dunking was viewed as the most
                exciting part of the game, the NBA even hosts an annual contest dedictaed to the act of dunking. Many still hold it in high regard though the 3 point shot has caught up with it in terms of popularity.<br><img src="https://i.giphy.com/BWCHh3nCM0qtRm5fyo.webp">

            <H3>Picks/Screens</H3>
            <p>
                A Pick or a screen is the act of a teammate who is currently not in possession of the ball setting himself in the pathway of an opponent to allow his teammate to evade said opponent easier than normal. A screen
                must be set before the opponent moves in its direction and the player setting the screen cannot move to further impede the opponent otherwise it is considered illegal<br><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/968yJlk9zWQYCVJ9hu_kngkvCbE=/1200x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8352921/bev.0.gif">

            <h3>Isolation</h3>
            <p>
                An isolation is a basketball play in where the player in possessio of the basketball calls out to his teammate to provide them with as much space as possible on the court, so that they can essentially obtain a 1 on 1 with their defender within the game.
                an isolation is extremely effective when the offensive player clearly has an advantage over their defender in terms of ability. If the offensive player can beat his defender every time then clearly that creates an easy opportunity for the offensive team.<br><img src="https://www.spox.com/de/sport/ussport/nba/2107/Bilder/chris-paul-isolation-gif.gif">
            </p>

            <h3>Triple threat</h3>
            <p>
                A triple threat occurs when the player in possession of the ball has not yet made any action in the half court as to what to do. This means that he is still able to dribble the ball dribble the ball without it being a violation, he is able to pass the ball to a teammate
                which is always an option or he can simply shoot the ball. This leaves the defender with a lot to think of as the player can fake any action and easily fool the defender creating a glaring advantage.<br><img src="https://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2457967/Untitled.gif">

            <h2 id="defense">Defense</h2>
            <H3>Lockdown</H3>
            <p>
                Lockdown defense occurs when a defender is able to play their opponent so well defensively that it leaves them with no good option of play other than to pass the ball away. This can mean an opponent is so overwhelmed by the defense
                that it causes them to lose the ball or it forces them to take a bad shot (each team has a set amou t of time to shoot when they are on offense).<br><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExY2l0eGtuM2NrZWhyOW00OTNhYWJ3YmZhMWE0bHI5MnM1eHprYWJnNyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ZFi7dmlrpeR9NrSeeW/giphy.gif">
            </p>

            <h3>Double-team</h3>
            <p>
                A double team occurs when a player is being gaurded by two defenders simultaneously for the purpose of either forcing them to make a mistake or forcinf them to pass the ball to a weaker player. A double team trap usually take place
                against the player who is playing the best and is considered to be too much of a threat to handle alone. This ultimately forces the ball into the hand of a weaker play who will hopefully make a poor
                decision on ball or miss their shot.<br><img src="https://basketballnews-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/story/body/bron%20vs%20trap.gif">
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Contest</h3>
            <p>
                Contesting a shot is the act of making an effortto block the shot or at the very least throw the attacker of with the possiblity of their shot being blocked. Ideally we would want
                for the shot to be blocked to putting the chances of it going in to absolute zero but alas that is not always possible. When contesting remember to make sure you do not foul your opponent
                as that nullifies the purpose ands ends the attacker to the line to takke free throws. Also try your best not to get faked out.<br><img src="https://thebrooklyngame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Steph-Pump.gif">
