                William Felton Russell despite averaging only 15 point per game across his career is said to be one of the greatest baketball players ever, why? Well Bill is evidence that the game is not only about scoring
                Bill was renowned for his stellar defense thus bringing along with it his nickname, The Secretary of Defense. Bill would find himself year on year with a stunning cast of players who as a collective were able to put it all together
                time after time, how many times? Well in Bill's case 11. this is the largest contributing factor to Bill's placement on the list of greats. not only was a an unbelievable defender and rebounder, but he also had the rings to show for it
                amasssing a mountainous 11 rings in only 13 seasons a feat that looks unachievable by any other play ever again.<br> Despite having such a tally bill has never won a finals MVP due to the fact that it was yet to have been given out before his final season.
                Bill did win that year, however the trophy was given out to Jerry West being the only time the losing party had a player win the finals MVP. the NBA did make yup for it though when they eventually decided to rename the award after the defensive star.
                this thpugh only proves how underappreciated defense is. If you need any evidence as to defense winning championships look no further than Bill.
