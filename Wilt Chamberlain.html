                Wilton Norman Chamberlain born August 21st 1936 was once considered the greatest player ever this was largely in part due to his unpresidented 72 NBA records for scoring, rebound and
                durability. Mostly remembered for his 100 point game Wilt is said to be mythical in stature. From the recollections of his tenure by many it is said that he was and unbelievable athlete. he was
                as strong, fast, and agile as he is tall and he was a dominating presence on the court. he once grabs 55 rebounds in a single game and has the record for Minutes per game in a season being 48.5, yes, there
                are only 48 minutes in a game which mean that he played every minute of every game plus overtime the entire season. Accumulating a stat which puts you in the company of Wilt Chamberlain 
                in any category is seen as an honor.
                <br>He was undoubtedly great but only manage to win 2 championships, why is that? iT could be down to the fact that his tenure sees him sandwiched in between the likes of 2 other greats
                on this list, namely Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul Jabbar who in the former's case could be said to have had a much better team their entire career. It also could be the fact that he played halfway through one of the most
                competitive stretches in NBA history which saw a plethora of teams finding success in that period. Wilt would play his final season as a laker join Jerry West in embarking on to this day
                the record for the longest winning streak in a season seing the two stars go on to win 33 games in a row.
                <br>Though Wilt's legacy often dictates him as a "loser" due to his lacks of drive and
                effort towrds the sport at times, it is often said to be comical just how easy the it was for Wilt to dominate.
