                LeBron Raymone James is considered by many to be the greatest player ever however, a larger majority are not quite inline we that thinking. We here believe he is a great basketball play either way.
                Born December 30th 1984 in akron ohio from a very early age many could se LeBron's potential. It was at in his years at Saint Vincent-Saint Mary High School where his stock really took off.
                He wasnt just good, he was the greatest youngster many had seen and with that also the greatest NBA prospect up to that point carrying with him freakish athletism and size. LeBron would be drafted by
                the Cavaliers 1st overall in 2003 but would struggle despite individual brilliance to make any dent in his championship aspirations. After nearly a decade with in Cleaveland LeBron would decide to leave for Miami
                bringing along with him Talented big man Chris Bosh and joining another one of our top 25 players Dwyane Wade. He would be labelled as the originator or the "super team" despite the fact that their have been said teams
                before his arrival in Miami.<br> Lebron and his assortment of stars struggled initially in miami after having promise to deliver multiple championships but eventually they woul manage to get it together winning in back to back years
                2012 and 2013. LeBron heart was still in Ohio his home state despite finding success elsewhere. At this point he would decide to return to Cleaveland where he would find himself at the center of another powerhouse in terms of talent
                and would go on to deliver that illustrious championship to Cleaveland defeating the 73 and 9 Warriors in a stunning 3 to 1 comeback.<br> Were not done yet, LeBron (would after a few more years of failing to repeat) find himself in Los Angeles
                at the center of it all in the most joint most prestigious franchise in the NBA the LA Lakers. He would initially disappoint many in LA due to their high expectation and love for Laker legend Kobe Bryant.
                but Lebron being the man he is would put it all together in the lockdown season of 2019 to 2020 and bring a ring to LA once more(less we forget he did again have his pick of talented co stars). Lebron is still active today
                and is the longest tenured player to ever play at this elite of a level. Why do majority hold Jordan over him then? Well, rings, mentality and nostalgia all seem to play a part. LeBron does however have the longevity factor over Jordan
                but unfortunately the longer he plays the worse his mentality seems to get which only further damages his case, or maybe it doesnt, who knows?
