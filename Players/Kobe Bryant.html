                Kobe Bean Bryant, born August 23 1978, regarded by many as the hardest working player to ever play the sport. Many a times would the tale be given of Kobe being the first to arrive
                and  the last to leave the gym getting it whatever work he could. Maybe kobe felt he need to do so to keep up with other competitors, Kobe was an average man in terms of physics for NBA standard.
                His hands were not big, he was not tall, he was not a super athlete, all he had was a relentless drive to be better than who he was the day before. Many consider Kobe to be a selfish player, this
                is in part to do with the many instances of him not passing to teammates opting rather to attempt a shot whether it be one, two or sometimes even three defenders on him.<br> Make no mistake however, Kobe was
                a student of a game and had a high basketball IQ. In his eyes those who did not work should not be expecting regular passess from him. That statement however is sort of contradictory to his time with laker legend
                and top 25 player Shaquille O'neal. Shaq was said by many to have little drive to work on his game despite being extremely strong and dominant as a force. Their pairing would see the lakers add three rings to their tally
                in the early 2000s (2000 to 2003) despite the two frequently falling out and bumping into chemistry issues with one another, this is a testament to how strong a force the pair were.<BR>
                Kobe for a long time was in the shadow of Shaq but after the big man departure bthe keys to LA were all his. Shaq went on to find further success in Miami in 2006 alongside Dwyane Wade anfd
                did not shy away from rubbing it in Kobe's face, he was one ring up. However Kobe would then go on to go back to back in 2009 and 2010 to overtake the bigman. Their relationship had at that point
                grown from the toxic culture in LA to a much more brotherly bound, but knowing the competitor Kobe is I am sur he took some time to rub it in Shaq's face.
