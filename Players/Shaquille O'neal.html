                Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal, coming out of college just about everybody knew his potential. He was big, he was strong and he was athletic. It felt like no one in college ball had asnwers for him
                , but could he replicate that in the NBA? Yes, yes he could. Drafted number 1 overall by the orlando magic in 1992 Shaq was an absolute nightmare for opposing players. He could overpower just about anyone
                and his original tandem duo with Penny Hardaway was just a brilliant fit. The two would bring the franchise joy for years on end but would ultimately fall short of any championships as this was the era of Jordan's 
                reign of terror. The league at the time was loaded with talent and teams and if it was not Jordan than it was someone else, everyone was gunning for that NBA title it seemed. Alas it just seemed that Shaq and Penny
                were just too young and too inexperienced. Shaq would ultimately split from penny and move to the much brighter lights of Los Angeles in search for improved success and, he would find it alongside talented guard Kobe Bryant.<br>
                Despite the struggle to get along off court due to the difference in personalities, work ethics and the clashing of egos the two were electric on court and were unstoppable for about 3 years as they would go on to win 3
                championship in a row from 2000 to 2003. The year after however, things boiled over, both had finally had enough and in a heated "me or him" scenario Shaq left LA to and moved to Miami. This decision is one the front office would
                initially feel like they would regret as in Miami Shaq was able to replicate his success in the 2006 season and  get his 4th ring (1 more thatn Kobe at the time) along side talented guard Dwyane Wade (What is it with Shaq and these athletic guards?).
                The older the bigamn got the less athletics he became but he was still quite difficult to deal with.<br> His enormous frame saw fit that he would dominate just about anyone inside the paint from rookie year to the tail end of his career. Shaq after
                Miami would go on to have a few more unsuccessful stints around the league in Phoenix, Boston, and Cleveland (where he eould play alongside Lebron James). In 2011 the bigman would ultimately decide to hang it up after a long, gritty
                and legendary career. Shaq was what many would consider a "Grown man", he would regulary make defenders look small and weak and displayed dominance we had not seen since Wilt. As tough as Diesel was on the court however,
                 many will remeber him for his fun antics and his kindness off the court. Today he is still involved in the sport as a analyst on an NBA affliated sports show.
