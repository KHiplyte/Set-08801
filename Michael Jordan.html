                Born Michael Jeffery Jordan at Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, February 17, 1963, he is considered by many as the great player of all time. that is partly due
                to his intense mentality and his alleged overwhelming presence on a court. many players who played with MJ have said that he was akin to a drill sergeant and demanded
                nothing but the best from his teammates. MJ initially struggled to reach anywhere significant in his early career finding himself being bounced out of titlt contention
                many a times in his early career most of those being at the hands of the pistons.<br> When Michael did take off however, he "took-off". With the passage of time helping Michael grow
                and the addition of a few key teammates Michael would go on the win 3 title back to back, retire, play baseball for a short stint then, return then repeat the championship feat again.
                In his first season of his baseball escapade Micheal's bulls team would break the nba record for most wins in a single season by obtaining a record 72 wins with only 8 loses.
                Michael would then go on to retire one more andthen return it is said by many that MJ's retirement is due to his love of the sport dwindling thanks to his repeated success.
                However, a man of such passion and ability could never stay away from the sport for too long. He would have a short 2 season run with the Washington Wizards but this was long past his prime.
                Nowadays Mj is more widely known for his jordan brand shoes, which a more or less the most notorious brand sneakers in the world
